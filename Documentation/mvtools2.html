    <h2><a name="MVTools"></a>I) About MVTools</h2>
    <p>
        MVTools plugin for AviSynth 2.6 is collection of functions for estimation
        and compensation of objects motion in video clips.
        Motion compensation may be used for strong temporal denoising, advanced
        framerate conversions, image restoration and other tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The plugin contains the motion estimation server-function MAnalyse to find
        the motion vectors and several motion compensation client-functions
        (MCompensate, MMask and others) which use these vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plugin uses block-matching method of motion estimation (similar methods are
        used in MPEG2, MPEG4, etc).
        At analysis stage plugin divides frames by small blocks and try to find for
        every block in current frame the most similar (matching) block in second frame
        (previous or next).
        The relative shift of these blocks is motion vector.
        The main measure of block similarity is sum of absolute differences (SAD) of
        all pixels of these two blocks compared.
        SAD is a value which says how good the motion estimation was.
    </p>
    <p>
        The output of MAnalyse (server) is special clip with motion vector
        information in some format.
    </p>
    <p>
        At compensation stage the plugin client functions read the motion vectors
        and use them to move blocks and form motion compensated frame (or realize some
        other full or partial motion compensation or interpolation function).
        Every object (block) in this (fully) compensated frame is placed in the same
        position as this object in current frame.
        So, we may (for example) use strong temporal denoising even for quite fast
        moving objects without producing annoying artefactes and ghosting (object's
        features and edges are coincide if compensation is perfect).
        Plugin can create compensated neighbor frames for every current frame, and
        denoise it by internal function.
        Alternatively, you can use compensated and original frames to create
        interleaved clip, denoise it by any external temporal filter, and select
        central cleaned original frames for output (see examples).
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, the motion estimation and compensation is not ideal and precise.
        In some complex cases (video with fading, ultra-fast motion, or periodic
        structures) the motion estimation may be completely wrong, and compensated
        frame will be blocky and (or) ugly.
        Severe difficulty is also due to objects mutual screening (occlusion) or
        reverse opening.
        Complex Avisynth scripts with many motion compensation functions may eat huge
        amount of memory and result in very slow processing.
        It is not simple but quite advanced plugin.
        Use it for appropriate cases only, and try tune its parameters.
        There are many discussions about motion compensation using at doom9 Avisynth
        forum.
        In particular see <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=76041">

        If you really interested in motion estimation and compensation topics, you can
        easy find numerous scientific publications (use WWW search).
    </p>
    <p>
        Notes: The plugin is still under development.
        Classic version have some limitations, only progressive YV12, YUY2 video is supported.
        Versions from 2.7.5.22 support all 420, 422, 444 planar YUV formats, 8 and 10-16 bits
        with recent Avisynth Plus versions.
        Use color format conversion and try using (smart) bob-deinterlace for
        interlaced video (<code>SeparateFields</code> may works too with or without
        <code>SelectEven</code>/<code>SelectOdd</code>).
        Some complex scripts (<code>QTGMC</code>, <code>TempGaussMC</code>,
        <code>MVBOB</code>, <code>MCBOB</code>) use MVTools for

    <h2><a name="version2"></a>II) About MVTools version 2</h2>
    <p>
        MVTools version 2 is a major internal and external upgrade.
        Main goals of MVTools v2.X branch are clarity and stability
        (in particular for multithreaded environment with multicore CPU) and of course
        performance and memory usage improving.
    </p>
    <p>
        Main mean for goals achievement is removing MVTools internal buffer
        with mysterious (for many people) index (idx) and some other internal tricks
        (see thread <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=131033">
            MVTools
            without idx
        </a>).
        To implement this without performance degradance we use normal effective
        Avisynth cache and introduce new mandatory preparation stage (before motion
        estimation by <code>MAnalyse</code>).
        At this stage a new function <code>MSuper</code> will get source clip and
        prepare special "super" clip with multilevel (hierarchical scaled) frames data
        (in previous MVTools versions 0.X-1.X these multilevel datas were prepared,
        saved and cached internally with idx as an index of pseudo-clip of these
        "superframes").
        The super clip is then used by both <code>MAnalyse</code> function and client
        motion compensation functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Related syntax change: some <code>MAnalyse</code> parameters (pel, sharp)
        are moved to <code>MSuper</code> function.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other essential external change is replacing all named clips parameters by
        unnamed (mandatory, without double-quotes in description) for normal work of
        Avisynth implicit "last" clip.
    </p>
    <p>Also faster planar processing for YUY2 is implemented in v2.0.</p>
    <p>
        Since v2.2 <code>MVTools.dll</code> is renamed to
        <code>mvtools2.dll</code>, and since v2.3 all functions are renamed from
        MVxxx to Mxxx (e.g. from <code>MVAnalyse</code> to <code>MAnalyse</code>),
        so you can continue to use old MVTools 1.x with your old scripts, and you
        are able to use / make new scripts with MvTools 2.x without changing the
        dll loading.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also have an intention to remove (not implement) some obsolete functions
        like MVDenoise, MVFlowFps2 (please, vote).
    </p>
    <p>Full list of changes see at <a href="#revisions">Revisions</a> section.</p>
    <p>
        Generally, new MVTools 2.0 should provide similar results as v1.11.4.
        Algorithm improvements is planned in v2.1 and later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: MVTools v1.x branch is not developed and not supported anymore
        (by Fizick).
    </p>
    <p>
        To benefit from native multi-threading, you'll have to install the
        latest <code>avstp.dll</code> in your plugin folder.
        This is recommended but not mandatory.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="functions"></a>III) Function descriptions</h2>
    <h3>Common parameters</h3>
    <p>
        Filters that use motion vectors have common parameters.
        Those are the scene-change detection thresholds, and the <var>isse</var> MMX
        flag.
        They also use one or several vectors stream, which are produced by
        <code>MAnalyse</code>.
    </p>
    <p class="var">thSCD1 (int, 400)</p>
    <p>
        Threshold which decides whether a block has
        changed between the previous frame and the current one.
        When a block has changed, it means that motion estimation for it isn't
        relevant.
        It occurs for example at scene changes.
        So it is one of the thresholds used to tweak the scene changes detection
        engine.
        Raising it will lower the number of blocks detected as changed.
        It may be useful for noisy or flickered video.
        The threshold is compared to the SAD (Sum of Absolute Differences, a value
        which says how bad the motion estimation was ) value.
        For exactly identical blocks we have SAD&nbsp;= 0. But real blocks are always
        different because of objects complex movement (zoom, rotation, deformation),
        discrete pixels sampling, and noise.
        Suppose we have two compared 8&times;8 blocks with every pixel different by 5.
        It this case SAD will be 8&times;8&times;5&nbsp;= 320 (block will not detected
        as changed for <var>thSCD1&nbsp;= 400</var>).
        Actually this parameter is scaled internally in MVTools,
        and it is always relative to 8x8 block size.
        Default is 400 (since v.1.4.1).
    </p>
    <p class="var">thSCD2 (int, 130)</p>
    <p>
        Threshold which sets how many blocks have to change
        for the frame to be considered as a scene change.
        It is ranged from 0 to 255, 0 meaning 0&nbsp;%, 255 meaning 100&nbsp;%.
        Default is 130 (which means 51&nbsp;%).
    </p>
    <p class="var">isse (bool, true)</p>
    <p>
        Flag which allows to enable (if set to True) or
        disable ISSE, MMX and other CPU optimizations (for debugging).
        If your processor doesn't support CPU optimizations, it will be disabled
        anyway (and you won't be able to activate them).
    </p>
    <p class="var">planar (bool, false)</p>
    <p>
        Flag to use special planar color format for YUY2
        clips both for input and output of function.
        It uses special trick for storing of frames with planar color data
        organisation (separate Y, U, V planes in memory) in normal interleaved YUY2
        frames format as a container.
        This way we can avoid numerous internal interleaved to planar conversions and
        increase speed.
        You can convert normal interleaved YUY2 source clip to planar format with
        <code>Interleaved2planar</code> function from
        <a href="http://home.pages.at/kassandro/RemoveGrain/">
            RemoveGrain plugin by
            kassandro
        </a>,
        and convert final result by <code>Planar2interleaved</code> function.
        This special planar YUY2 format is also supported by Removegrain plugin by
        Kassandro, MaskTools2 plugin by Manao and some others.
        This trick will not be needed in Avisynth v2.6 with native support of planar
        YV16 format.
        This paramenter is ignored for YV12 clips. Note: super clip is always planar.
    </p>

    <h3>MSuper</h3>
<pre class="proto">MSuper (
	clip,
	int  hpad (8),
	int  vpad (8),
	int  pel (2),
	int  levels (0),
	bool chroma (true),
	int  sharp (2),
	int  rfilter (2),
	clip pelclip (undefined),
	bool isse,
	bool planar,
	bool mt (true)
)</pre>
    <p>
        Get source clip and prepare special "super" clip with multilevel
        (hierarchical scaled) frames data.
        The super clip is used by both <code>MAnalyse</code> and motion compensation
        (client) functions.
        For storing and transferring its parameters we use audio properties of super
        clip (specifically, <code>num_audio_samples</code>) as a trick.
        So, audio is killed in super clip.
        That is one of reasons why we additionally use source clip with client
        functions.
        You may have a look to super clip yourself (it has normal format).
        Supported formats: greyscale, YUV and planar RGB 8-32 bits, YUY2
        You can use different Super clip for generationg vectors with MAnalyze and a different
        super clip format for the actual action. Thus MFlowFPS can support native RGB (planar),
        and MDegrain can work with 32 bit float input clips.
    </p>
    <p class="var">hpad</p>
    <p>
        It is horizontal padding added to source frame (both left and right).
        Small padding is added for more correct motion estimation near frame borders.
        (In MVTools before v2.0 the value of padding = block size was always used
        internally. Now it is not strict but recommended value.)
    </p>
    <p class="var">vpad</p>
    <p>It is vertical padding added to source frame (both top and bottom).</p>
    <p class="var">pel</p>
    <p>
        It is the accuracy of the motion estimation.
        Value can only be 1, 2 or 4.
        1 means a precision to the pixel.
        2 means a precision to half a pixel,
        4 means a precision to quarter a pixel, produced by spatial interpolation
        (more accurate but slower and not always better due to big level scale step).
        Default is 2 since v1.4.10.
    </p>
    <p class="var">levels</p>
    <p>
        It is the number of hierarchical levels in super clip frames.
        <code>MAnalyse</code> is need in all levels, but for other client functions
        single finest level is enough (coarser levels are not used).
        0&nbsp;= auto, all possible levels are produced.
    </p>
    <p class="var">chroma</p>
    <p>
        If set to true, it allows to prepare chroma planes too in superclip.
        False means luma only.
    </p>
    <p class="var">sharp</p>
    <p>
        Subpixel interpolation method for <var>pel</var>&nbsp;= 2 or 4.
        Use:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr><td><b>0</b></td><td>for soft interpolation (bilinear),</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>1</b></td><td>for bicubic interpolation (4 tap Catmull-Rom),</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>2</b></td><td>for sharper Wiener interpolation (6 tap, similar to Lanczos).</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        This parameter controls the calculation of the first level only.
        When <var>pel&nbsp;= 4</var>, bilinear interpolation is always used to compute
        the second level.
    </p>
    <p class="var">rfilter</p>
    <p>Hierarchical levels smoothing and reducing (halving) filter.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td><b>0</b></td><td>Simple 4 pixels averaging like unfiltered SimpleResize (old method),</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>1</b></td><td>Triangle (shifted) filter like <code>ReduceBy2</code> for more smoothing (decrease aliasing),</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>2</b></td><td>Triangle filter like <code>BilinearResize</code> for even more smoothing,</td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>3</b></td>
            <td>
                Quadratic filter for even more smoothing,</li>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><b>4</b></td><td>Cubic filter like <code>BicubicResize(b=1, c=0)</code> for even more smoothing.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Default is 2 (since v2.3.1).
        You may also try to apply some external filter to superclip or its coarse
        bottom part (by appropriate crop and overlay).
    </p>
    <p class="var">pelclip</p>
    <p>
        Optional upsampled source clip for using instead of internal subpixel
        interpolation (for <var>pel&nbsp;&gt; 1</var>).
        Pixels at rows and colunms positions multiple to pel (0, 2, 4,… for
        <var>pel&nbsp;= 2</var>) (without padding) must be original source pixels,
        other pixels must be interpolated.
        Example for <var>pel&nbsp;= 2</var>:
    </p><p>
<pre class="src">LanczosResize (width*2, height*2, src_left=0.25, src_top=0.25)</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent note: it is true for luma, but it doesn't correspond to chroma
        pixels positions of internal MVTools interpolation.
        Nevertheless vectors and motion compensation are quite similar for usual
        clips, same chroma would be with <code>src_left&nbsp;= 0.5</code> for YUY2 and
        additionally <code>src_top&nbsp;= 0.5</code> for YV12.
    </p>
    <p>Other useful example is EEDI2 edge-directed resampler.</p>
    <p class="var">mt</p>
    <p>Enables internal multi-threading (through avstp.dll).</p>

    <p>
        Get prepared multilevel super clip, estimate motion by block-matching
        method and produce special output clip with motion vectors data (used by other
        functions).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some hierarchical multi-level search methods are implemented (from coarse
        image scale to finest).
        Function uses zero vector and neighbors blocks vectors as a predictors for
        current block.
        Firstly difference (SAD) are estimated for predictors, then candidate vector
        changed by some values to some direction, SAD is estimated, and so on.
        The accepted new vector is the vector with minimal SAD value (with some
        penalty for motion coherence).
    </p>
    <p>
        Try using <code>MShow</code> function to check estimated motion field and
        tune parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: <code>MAnalyse</code> (if <var>pel&nbsp;&ge; 2</var>) detects fieldbased
        video flag (after <code>SeparateFields</code>) and automatically makes
        correction of motion vectors according to verticlal shift of fields with

    <p>
        Technical note: MAnalyse does not generate a regular clip that can be
        displayed.
        Don't try to modify its content or it will get corrupted.
        It is made of a single long line, actually containing binary data (vectors,
        block SAD, misc. information…) instead of pixel values.
        It also alters the audio descriptor to pass additional data to other
        filters before any frame request.
        Therefore, in the current state, a vector clip cannot be saved to a lossless
        file and reloaded later for processing.
        If you want to do so, you have to transcode it first with
        <code>MStoreVect</code> and <code>MRestoreVect</code>.
        Furthermore, joining vector clips generated with different parameters may
        lead to unexpected results, because the aforementioned additional data is
        global to the whole clip and is not updated on each frame.
        When the MAnalyse filter is destructed (removed from the memory), the
        additional data is lost too, and an attempt to using the produced vectors
        may crash the application or give wrong results.
        For this reason, avoid using MAnalyse in <code>ScriptClip</code> and other
        functions of the Avisynth runtime subsystem.

    <p class="var">blksizeV</p>
    <p>
        Vertical size of a block.
        Default is equal to horizontal size.
    </p>
    <p class="var">levels</p>
    <p>
        A positive value is the number of levels used in the hierarchical
        analysis made while searching for motion vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Negative or zero value is the number of coarse levels NOT used in the
        hierarchical analysis made while searching for motion vectors.
        The lower the usually better (vectors with any length can be found).
        It is kept variable for study's purposes mostly.
        Sometimes <var>levels</var> is useful to prevent large (false) vectors
        (computer graphics, etc).
        Default = 0 since v.2.5 (all levels are used).
    </p>
    <p class="var">search, searchparam, pelsearch</p>
    <p>
        <var>search</var> decides the type of search at every level,
        <var>searchparam</var> is an additional parameter (step, radius) for this
        search, and <var>pelsearch</var> is the radius parameter at finest (pel)
        level.
        Below are the possible values for the <var>search</var> type:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr><td><b>0</b></td><td>'OneTimeSearch'. <var>searchparam</var> is the step between each vectors tried (if <var>searchparam</var> is superior to 1, step will be progressively refined).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>1</b></td><td>'NStepSearch'. N is set by <var>searchparam</var>. It's the most well known of the MV search algorithm.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>2</b></td><td>Logarithmic search, also named Diamond Search. <var>searchparam</var> is the initial step search, there again, it is refined progressively.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>3</b></td><td>Exhaustive search, <var>searchparam</var> is the radius (square side is 2*radius+1). It is slow, but it gives the best results, SAD-wise.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>4</b></td><td>Hexagon search, <var>searchparam</var> is the range. (similar to x264).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>5</b></td><td>Uneven Multi Hexagon (UMH) search, <var>searchparam</var> is the range. (similar to x264).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>6</b></td><td>pure Horizontal exhaustive search, <var>searchparam</var> is the radius (width is 2*radius+1).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>7</b></td><td>pure Vertical exhaustive search, <var>searchparam</var> is the radius (height is 2*radius+1).</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p class="var">isb</p>
    <p>
        Allows to choose between a forward search (motion from the previous frame
        to current one) for <var>isb&nbsp;=false</var> and a backward search (motion
        from following frame to the current one) for <var>isb&nbsp;=true</var> (isb
        stands for "IS Backward", it is implemented and named exactly as written here,
        do not ask :-).
    </p>
    <p class="var">chroma</p>
    <p>
        Set to true, it allows to take chroma into account when
        doing the motion estimation (false: luma only).
    </p>
    <p class="var">delta</p>
    <p>
        Set the frame interval between the reference frame and the current frame.
        By default, it's 1, which means that the motion vectors are searched between
        the current frame and the previous (or next) frame.
        Setting it to 2 will allow you to search mvs between the frame n and n-2 or
        n+2 (depending on the <var>isb</var> setting).
        If delta is negative or null, -delta is the absolute index of a fixed
        reference frame.
        In this case, the <var>isb</var> value is ignored.
        Only a few functions are compatible with fixed reference frames
        (<code>MCompensate</code>, <code>MFlow</code> and <code>MDegrain*</code>).
    </p>
    <p class="var">pzero</p>
    <p>
        relative penalty (scaled to 256) to SAD cost for zero vector.
        It prevent replacing of quite good predictor by zero vector with a little
        better SAD (<var>lambda</var> is not used for zero vector).
        Default is equal to <var>pnew</var> since v1.11.
    </p>
    <p class="var">pglobal</p>
    <p>
        Relative penalty (scaled to 256) to SAD cost for global predictor vector.
        (<var>lambda</var> is not used for global vector).
    </p>
    <p class="var">overlap</p>
    <p>
        block overlap value (horizontal).
        Must be even and less than block size (up to <var>blksize/2</var> for
        <code>MCompensate</code>).
        The step between blocks for motion estimation is equal to
        (<var>blksize</var> &minus;&nbsp;<var>overlap</var>).
        N blocks cover the size
        ((<var>blksize</var> &minus;&nbsp;<var>overlap</var>) *&nbsp;N +&nbsp;<var>overlap</var>)
        on frame.
        Try using overlap value from <var>blksize/4</var> to b<var>blksize/2</var>.
        The greater overlap, the more blocks number, and the lesser the processing
        speed.
        However the default value 0 may cause blocking-like artefacts.
        Functions with overlap support are:
        <code>MFlow</code>, <code>MFlowInter</code>, <code>MFlowFps</code>,
        <code>MShow</code>, <code>MMask</code>, <code>MCompensate</code> and all the
        <code>MDeGrain*</code>.

    <p>
        Name of file to write motion vectors data, or an empty string (nothing

        This data may be used by some external program or may be by next MVTools
        versions for second pass coding, etc.
        Produced binary file has a header (<code>MVAnalysisData</code> structure,
        see <code>MVInterface.h</code> source code), and the data sequence:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frame number,</li>
        <li>vector data (Vx, Vy, SAD) of every block,</li>

        Important: using <var>outfile</var> in a multi-threaded context (Classic Avisynth MT modes
        1, 2 and 4, or setting other than MT_SERIALIZED for Avisynth+) has an undefined behaviour and will generate a corrupted file.

    <h4>Truemotion parameters</h4>
    <p>
        There are few advanced parameters which set coherence of motion vectors
        for so called true motion estimation.
        Some matched blocks from other frame may be most similar to sample blocks of
        current frame by intensity criterion (SAD), but not correspond to true object
        motion.
        For example, they may belong to other similar object in different corner of
        the frame or belong to some periodic structure.
        "True motion" parameters try maintain the motion field more coherent, instead
        of some random vectors distribution.
        It is especially important for partial motion compensation and interpolation.
        Some parameters are experimental and may be removed (replaced) in next
        versions after testing.
        Please report your conclusions.
    </p>
    <p class="var">truemotion</p>
    <p>
        This is a preset of these parameters values.
        It allows easy to switch default values of all "true motion" parameters at once.
        Set it <var>true</var> for true motion search (high vector coherence),
        set it <var>false</var> to search motion vectors with best SAD.
        Default is true since v1.4.10.
        In any case you can tune each parameter individually.
    </p>
    <p class="var">lambda</p>
    <p>
        Set the coherence of the field of vectors.
        The higher, the more coherent.
        However, if set too high, some best motion vectors can be missed.
        Values around 400&ndash;2000 (for block size 8) are strongly recommended.
        Internally it is coefficient for SAD penalty of vector squared difference
        from predictor (neighbors), scaled by 256.
        Default is 0 for <var>truemotion&nbsp;= false</var> and
        1000*<var>blksize</var>*<var>blksizeV</var>/64

        (smoothly since v1.10.2) if SAD value of vector predictor (formed from
        neighbor blocks) is greater than the limit.
        It prevents bad predictors using but decreases the motion coherence.
        Values above 1000 are recommended for true motion.
        Scaled to 8x8 blocksize internally (since v2.0.11).
        Default is 400 for <var>truemotion&nbsp;= false</var> and 1200 for
        <var>truemotion&nbsp;= true</var>.
    </p>
    <p class="var">pnew</p>
    <p>
        Relative penalty (scaled to 256) to SAD cost for new candidate vector.
        New candidate vector must be better will be accepted as new vector only if its
        SAD with penalty (SAD + SAD*pnew/256) is lower then predictor cost (old SAD).
        It prevent replacing of quite good predictors by new vector with a little
        better SAD but different length and direction.
        Default is 0 for <var>truemotion&nbsp;= false</var> and 50 for

    <p>
        Do a motion compensation of the frame not by blocks (like
        <code>MCompensate</code>), but by pixels.
        Motion vector for every pixel is calculated by bilinear interpolation of
        motion vectors of current and neighbor blocks (according to pixel position).
        It means that the pixels pointed by the vector in the reference frame
        will be moved (flow) along the vectors to reach their places in the current
        frame.
        This flow motion compensation method does not produce any blocking artefactes,
        and is good for denoising, but sometimes can create very strange deformed
        pictures.
        True motion estimation is strongly recommended for this function.
        Motion compensation may be full or partial (at intermediate time).

        Motion interpolation function.
        It is not the same (but similar) as <code>MVInterpolate</code> function of
        older MVTools version.
        It uses backward <var>mvbw</var> and forward <var>mvfw</var> motion vectors
        to create picture at some intermediate time moment between current and next
        (by delta) frame.
        It uses pixel-based (by <code>MFlow</code> method) motion compensation from
        both frames.
        Internal forward and backward occlusion masks (<code>MMask</code>
        <var>kind&nbsp;= 2</var> method) and time weighted factors are used to produce
        the output image with minimal artefacts.
        True motion estimation is strongly recommended for this function.

    <p class="var">tclip</p>
    <p>
        If set, the <var>time</var> parameter is ignored.
        Then the time for the motion interpolation is applied pixel-wise.
        Each component of each pixel of <var>tclip</var> gives the time to be applied
        to the corresponding <var>source</var> clip pixel.
        The time scale is 256, meaning that 0 corresponds to the current frame,
        and 255 is an almost the next frame (128 is exactly half-way).
        A single occlusion mask is calculated with the luma-time only,
        therefore it is recommended to keep the chroma-time synchronized
        with the luma.

        divide, etc.
        The two-stage method may be also useful for more stable (robust) motion
        estimation.
        The refining is at finest hierarchical level only.
        Interpolated vectors of old blocks are used as predictors for new vectors,
        with recalculation of SAD.
        Only bad quality new vectors with SAD above threshold <var>thSAD</var> will be
        re-estimated by search.
        <var>thSAD</var> value is scaled to 8x8 block size.

)</pre>
    <p>
        Rescales motion vectors / blocksize.
        Main purpose is to allows vectors to be used on a differently sized clip or on a clip having different bit depth (2.7.24-) than
        they were analyzed from.
    </p>
    <p>Example steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use <code>MAnalyze</code> on a half-sized clip at block size 16</li>
        <li>Use this plugin to scale the vectors by 2 to block size 32</li>
        <li>
            Use resulting vectors for <code>MFlowFPS</code>, <code>MDegrain</code>,…
            on the full sized frame.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Saves doing the <code>MAnalyze</code> on the full size frame, which may be
        faster and saves memory (good for multi-threading).
        Note that you need a super clip for each frame size.
        The padding (hpad, vpad) on each super clip must be manually scaled to match
        the vector scaling (can be easier to set <var>hpad&nbsp;= 0</var> and
        <var>vpad&nbsp;= 0</var> everywhere).
        See the example below.
        Similar functionality was available in MVTools through the function
        <code>MVIncrease</code>, but it was removed.
    </p>
    <p>The function returns a new motion vector clip.</p>
    <p class="var">vectors</p>

        Motion vectors returned from <code>MAnalyse</code> or

    </p>
    <p class="var">scale, scaleV</p>
    <p>
        The amount to scale the vectors, <var>scale</var> is the horizontal
        scaling, <var>scaleV</var> is the vertical scaling.
        Exact meaning depends on mode.
        Default value is 2.0, except when <var>bits</var> is given (in this case 1.0)
    </p>
    <p class="var">mode</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td><b>0</b></td><td>Increase scale of vectors and blocksize. Only scale values of 1, 2, 4 or 8 are allowed. Mode 0 allows you to <code>MAnalyze</code> at a smaller size, then process (<code>MDeGrain</code>, <code>MFlowFPS</code>, whatever) at full size.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>1</b></td><td>Decrease scale of vectors and blocksize. Only scale values of 1, 2, 4 or 8 are allowed. Mode 1 allows you to <code>MAnalyze</code> at full size, but have some subsequent processes run at a smaller size.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>2</b></td><td>Only scale vectors, leave blocksize unchanged. Any floating point scale value is allowed (including negative). Mode 2 is for esoteric uses, for example approximating backward vectors from forward ones, or for extrapolation.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p class="var">flip</p>
    <p>
        Whether to flag forward vectors as backward vectors, and vice versa.
        Only applies to <var>mode&nbsp;= 2</var>.
        Default is true if scale is negative and equal to <var>scaleV</var>.
        I.e. if you reverse the vectors it will default to flip their direction.
    </p>
    <p class="var">adjustSubPel</p>
    <p>
        Set to true in <var>mode&nbsp;= 0, 1</var> to perform scaling by adjusting
        subpel rather than scaling vectors.
        <var>scale</var> must be equal to <var>scaleV</var>.
        Experimental.
    </p>
    <p class="var">bits</p>
    <p>
        Change the bit depth that the motion vector clip is reporting.
        Possible values: 0 (default), 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. Value of 0 does not change bit depth.
        During the conversion SAD values for each block are scaled according to the bit-depth difference. The scaling factor is 2^(bits - source_bit_depth) with rounding when scaling down.
        E.g. analyze your clip in 8 bits (faster), then use vectors for a 16 bit super clip by setting <var>bits</var>=16
    </p>

    <p>
        This parameter can be combined with x and y scaling.
        Warning: when this parameter exists and is nonzero then the default value of <var>scale</var> is 1.0 instead of 2.0.
    </p>

    <h4>Example</h4>
<pre class="src">clip = YourSource( "Your\Video" )

# Half size clip
clipScaled = clip.BicubicResize( clip.Width()/2, clip.Height()/2 )

# Half size padding (may be easier to always set hpad and vpad to 0)

# Analyze half-size clip - faster, uses less memory
bVecScaled  = superScaled.MAnalyse( blksize=8, isb=true )

    <h3>MStoreVect</h3>
<pre class="proto">MStoreVect (
	clip   vectors, ...,

    <p>
        Stores (multiple) motion vectors in a encodable clip.
        Allows you to encode vectors to a file (must use a lossless format, suggest
        Lagarith for RGBA).
        Convenient for splitting up very slow scripts (e.g. calculate vectors and save
        in pass 1, load vectors and process in stage 2).
        Can also use to process the same footage in multiple ways.
        Use <code>MRestoreVect</code> to get the motion vectors back out of the
        clip.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can store as many sets of vectors as you wish in a single clip, as long
        as the clips have the same length.
        It's possible to store a multi-vector clip too.
        The clip can be in any of the supported colorspaces;
        its width and height will vary depending on the contained clips, but the
        height will always be divisible by 2.
    </p>
    <p>The function returns a clip that contains the provided motion vectors.</p>
    <p class="var">vectors</p>
    <p>MVTools vectors clip, you may pass as many clips as you wish.</p>
    <p class="var">vccs</p>
    <p>
        Colorspace of the output clip.
        Only "RGB32", "RGB24" and "YUY2" are currently supported.
        Default (empty string) is RGB32.
    </p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
<pre class="src">clip = YourSource( "Your\Video" )
super = clip.MSuper()
bVec1 = super.MAnalyse( isb=true )

    <h3>MRestoreVect</h3>
<pre class="proto">MRestoreVect (

	int  index (0)
)</pre>
    <p>
        Fetches a single motion vector clip from a special clip prepared earlier
        by <code>MStoreVect</code> (see above).
        Call multiple times if there are several clips stored.
    </p>
    <p>The function returns a single motion vectors clip.</p>
    <p class="var">store</p>

    <p class="var">index</p>
    <p>
        The zero-based index of the vectors to restore, used when multiple vector
        clips were stored.
        I.e. index 0 recovers the first vectors stored in the clip, index 1 the
        second, etc.
    </p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
<pre class="src">clip = YourSource( "Your\Video" )

# Created using MStoreVectors above, losslessly encoded
vectors = AviSource( "MotionVectors.avi" )

# See example above for MStoreVectors, gets the first of the two stored vector clips

    <h2><a name="revisions"></a>VI) Revisions</h2>
    <p>2.7.36 (20181120)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: Allow overlap operation when there are only two blocks in either horizontal or vertical direction (was: division by 0 crash)</li>
        <li>
            Fix: Fallback to overlap=0 mode when block count is only 1 in either h or v direction (was: undefined behaviour)<br />
            The cases above occured for small frame sizes, when frame size and overlap values resulted in less than 3 blocks in a direction.
        </li>
        <li>Misc: update html docs with overlap drawing and others.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.35 (20181113)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MFlowXXX: Slight speed gain by putting the out-of-frame vector check to resizer</li>
        <li>MAnalyze: Fix a possible internal overflow on larger blocksizes with small overlap e.g. BlkSize=32, OverlapX=0, OverlapY=4.</li>
        <li>MSuper: Planar RGB support</li>
        <li>MFlowFPS: Planar RGB support: generate vectors in YUV, use RGB input and super clip</li>
        <li>MFlowFPS: less memory for 4:4:4 and greyscale</li>
        <li>MFlowFPS: a bit faster 4:4:4, much faster greyscale</li>
        <li>MFlowFPS: support different bit depth for clip and the vectors (use vectors from 8 bit analysis for a 16 bit clip)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.34 (20181108)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MFlowInter: Use less memory, eliminates ten full-frame internal buffers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.33 (20181021)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MFlowXX: Fix random access violation caused by enlarged vectors pointing on out-of-frame positions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.32 (20181018)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MAnalyze: Enhance mt mode report for Avisynth+: MT_SERIALIZED instead of MT_MULTI_INSTANCE when temporal=true or using output file.</li>
        <li>MAnalyze: fix a possible internal overflow on larger blocksizes and lambda combinations. e.g. truemotion=true with blksize=32</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.31 (20180409)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: MFlow: SC detection after having the mv clip. Fixed in 2.5.11.22 but was missed during 2.6.0.5 merge.</li>
        <li>Fix: MFlow: crash in 16bit 4:2:0, mode=1</li>
        <li>Fix: MDegrain, out16=true: Green bottom lines when overlap blocks are not covering the full vertical area</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.30 (20180405)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: crash in MFlowInter (and possibly other MFlow...) v2.7.29 revelead this additional bug (which was not even 100% reproducible), this fix is basically the 2nd part of the solution.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.29 (20180403)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: MFlowInter (and possibly other MFlow...) crash with specific combination of analyze parameters (e.g. blkSize=16,overlapv=4,divide=1). Bug existed since at least 2.5.11.22</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.28 (20180323)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: in MDegrain1-6/N allow Y8 input for out16 parameter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.27 (20180318)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: MDepan: use zerow parameter. The parameter had no effect probably since it was introduced</li>
        <li>MDepan: report MT mode for Avisynth+. MT_MULTI_INSTANCE, except for logfile writing output mode (MT_SERIALIZED)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.26 (20180314)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MDegrain1-6 and N: new parameter bool "out16" = false. If set, 8 bit input results in native 16bit output (like lsb=true hack but this is native). Faster than lsb=true by up to 12% (i7-7700)</li>
        <li>Faster: special 10 bit SAD functions instead of the generic 10-16bit one. Depending on the block size, 4-17% gain for a typical MDegrain1-6 session</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.25 (20180227)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: x64: not-cleared mmx state in MSuper assembly code would cause crash later, e.g. in x264 encoding, depending on following filters.</li>
        <li>Fix: MSCDetection SC value parameter name to Ysc from Yth (must be an ancient typo), docs are OK, but the fix is mentioned in docs</li>
        <li>
            MSuper: import 8 bit sse2 interpolators from mvtools-vs. Extend them for 10-16bits (faster super clip). Some filters are still todo.
        </li>
        <li>MSuper: support 32bit float clips, which can be used later by MDegrains (but not for MAnalyse)</li>
        <li>MDegrains: allow degraining clip with different bit depth from vectors. Clip and Super must be the same bit depth. Their subsampling must match that of motion vector base clips</li>
        <li>MDegrains: consistently use limit and limitC, 255 do nothing, otherwise scale 0-254 value to the current bit-depth range</li>
        <li>
            Overlaps: more correct internal rounding for 8 bits:<br />
            old: pixel = Sum( (tmp + 256) >> 6) >> 5<br />
            new: pixel = (Sum( (tmp + 32) >> 6) + 16) >> 5<br />
            Overlaps: round for 16bits<br />
            old: pixel = Sum(tmp) >> 11<br />
            new: pixel = (Sum(tmp) + 1024) >> 11<br />
        </li>
        <li>Overlaps: 32bit float (but still use the original 11 bit window constants)</li>
        <li>Project: change from yasm to nasm.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.24 (20171205)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: MFlowBlur: possible access violation crash when nPel>1</li>
        <li>New: MScaleVect parameter 'bits'. e.g. Analyze 8 bit clips, use their vectors for 16 bits</li>
        <li>Move project to VS2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.23 (20171012)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix: MScaleVect wrong rounding of scaled motion vectors with negative components. e.g. proper scaling (-1;-2) to (-2;-4) instead of (-1,-3).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.22 (20170830)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Misc: Stop using version suffix .22</li>
        <li>Fix: [DCT 8x8@8bit] garbage on x64: internal assembly code did not save xmm6/xmm7</li>
        <li>Fix: [DCT 8x8@8bit] safe multithreading for integer DCT (8x8 block size, 8 bit video): assembly had a single working buffer.</li>
        <li>Fix: [MDegrain] did not release input motion vector clips in destructor, possible hang at script closing. Bug since 2.7.1.22 (when introducing MDegrain4/5)</li>
        <li>Mod: fftw conversion constant of sqrt(2)/2 is more accurate (was:0.707), 16 bit formats may benefit (by feisty2)</li>
        <li>Fix: SSE4 assembly instructions in x64, broke on non-SSE4 processors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2.7.21.22 (20170629)</p>

    <p>2.7.19.22 (20170525)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            New: [MMask] Support any planar input video formats e.g. greyscale, Planar RGB.<br />
            Input clip can even be of different bit depth or format from vector's original format<br />
            For kind==5 where U and V is filled, the greyscale option is not allowed
        </li>
        <li>Mod: [MMask] Faster: request source frame only for kind=5.</li>

            Fix: [MMask] proper 10+ bits scene change values (for default: 1023, 4095, 16383, 65535. Was: 65535)<br />
            Parameter is still in 8-bit range
        </li>
        <li>Fix: [MRecalculate] prevent overflow during thSAD scaling in 16 bits or large block sizes (32, 48...)</li>
        <li>Fix: [DepanEstimate] Sometimes giving wrong motion instead of scene change detection</li>

        <li>
            New: Chroma SAD is now always half of luma SAD, regardless of video format. <br />
            Without this: YV24's luma:chroma SAD ratio is 4:8 instead of 4:2 (of YV12)

                Some bug fixes (memory leaks), code consolidation (rewriting) for stability and performance improvements.
                Also there is a multitude of changes due to the addition of threading class,
                semaphore class, critical section class, thread files for MVDegrain, MVAnalyseMulti
                as well as factoring out common code for MVDegrain into a single base class moving out common code etc.
                There are no changes of algorithms.

        </ul>
        <p>0.9.8</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Yet another little changes in the filters' syntax. The core changed a lot,
                in order to gain speed were it was possible. However, by default, the speed gain won't be
                visible, you'll need to configure correctly the analysis filter through its "idx"
                parameter in order to gain speed ( in the mode "pel" = 2 ).
            </li>
            <li>Bugfixes in MVDenoise, and chroma denoising in MVDenoise.</li>
            <li>
                Now, the filters down the filter's chain tell to the analysis filter if they need
                the compensation, so you don't have to worry about that at the analysis stage.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.7</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Yet again, a lot of rewriting. Interpolating filters are disabled ( for the moment ),
                all the other filters work and should be considered as stable. Syntax has changed a lot,
                and will change again before reaching 1.0 ( if it's reached one day ). Changes mainly affect
                <code>MVAnalyse</code>. New filter :  <code>MVChangeCompensate</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.6.2</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Fixed bug in <code>MVMask</code> parameters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.6.1</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lot of bugfixes for the existing filters. MVMask, MVShow, MVCompensate, MVDenoise and MVSCDetection, and MVAnalyse should work .
                Other may crash unexpectedly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now, for the three new filters. Two have nothing to do with motion compensation,
                but I didn't want to put them in separate binaries, since they'll mainly be used with filters from this package.
                The third one uses vectors, and integrates somehow the two others.
            </li>
            <li>
                QDeQuant(clip c, int quant, int level) : takes a clip and quantizes it, using an approximation of the H264 DCT.
                It filters the three planes ( 4x4 blocks for each of them, so the chroma isn't processed as in H264 ).
                It's not exactly the H264 DCT because at q1, it's lossless, and a q51 it's not that bad, but you can raise quant over 51.
                Level is the reference level of the picture.
                By default it's zero, but it can be set, for example, to 128.
                The picture is then treates as if pixels were ranging from -128 to 127, hence avoiding errors around 128.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deblock(clip c, int quant, int aOffset, int bOffset ) : takes a clip, and deblock it using H264 deblocking,
                as if the picture was made only of inter blocks. This time, quant ranges from 0 to 51 as in H264, and has the same impact.
                aOffset and bOffset allow to raise / lower the quant when deciding for some internal thresholds.
                They are set by default to 0. Be warned that the filter should do nothing at quant lesser 16, if aOffset and bOffset are both zero.
                It's a wanted behavior ( thus it respect the partially the norm ).
            </li>
            <li>
                EncDenoise(clip c, clip vectors, bool scbehavior, int quant, int aOffset, int bOffset, int thSCD1, int thSCD2) :
                it merges Deblock, QDeQuant and MVCompensate, taking from them the name and behavior of their parameters.
                It basically does a h264 encode as if all blocks were 8x8 inter blocks.
                Reference frame is the previous frame output by the filter ( if it is the correct one, else it's the previous frame of the source ),
                mvs are those given by mvanalyse on the source. The reference frame is compensated by the vectors,
                then the residual difference is quantized / dequantized and added to the result of the motion compensation.
                Finally, the frame is deblocked, and serves as reference for the next one.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Mainly a bugfixe ( several filters were affected by a silly bug , and MVCompensate now do padded motion compensation,
                and compensate also the chroma ( though it rounds the vector to odd coordinates to do so )
            </li>
            <li>
                A new feature, as asked by Fizick, for mvcompensate :
                "scbehavior", a boolean set to true by default, will allow you to keep the previous frame over a scenechange if you set it to false.

        <ul>
            <li>
                MVMask has two new parameters : showsad (bool) which allows to build the mask of the SAD values instead of the mask of the vectors' length.
                Ysc allows you to set the value taken by the mask on scene changes
            </li>
            <li>MVCompensate : behavior modification on scene changes. Now, the current frame is left untouched if a scene change was detected.</li>
            <li>New filter : MVSCDetection, with one parameter, Ysc, which works as previouslymscdetection.</li>
            <li>MVInterpolate, MVConvertFPS and MVBlur are enabled, but may be buggy ( though I wasn't able to make MVConvertFPS crash )</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Huge rewritting of the core engine. Vectors are now searched with a
                precision up to the pixel ( because no other filters can use yet more
                precise vectors, except MVShow ). The search engine is now fast ( which
                doesn't mean necessarily that the filters which use it are fast )
            </li>
            <li>
                A new parameter for MVAnalyse : lambda. See the documentation of the
                filter to see how it works
            </li>
            <li>MVDenoise works better.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Vectors can be saved to a file. In order to do so, add the parameter
                filename="C:\foo.bar" to the filter MVAnalyse. If the file doesn't exist,
                vectors will be saved into it. If it exists, vectors will be read from it. But,
                be warned :
                <ul>
                    <li>The file for a whole movie will be around 500 MB</li>
                    <li>
                        Saving / reading from a file need for the moment a linear access to
                        the frames, so it has to be used only when encoding the movie, not when doing
                        random access in it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The speed gain is not as great as one may hope, because SADs can't be
                        saved ( it would take too much space ) and so have to be recomputed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The filter MVDenoise now works on 5 frames, and its parameters are now
                "thT" and "sadT" ( have a look in the documentation to see how they work ). It
                works nice ( very good for heavy denoising )
            </li>
            <li>
                The scene change detection thresholds have slightly changed. Now, a block
                has changed if its SAD it over thSCD1. The default for thSCD1 is 300, and for
                thSCD2 it is 130. It orks well ( better than the previous SCD engine ).<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>0.9.3</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Last cleanings in the search of the motion vectors. It should be slightly
                faster
            </li>
            <li>
                More search parameters can be set by the user, especially the search
                algorithm. See the documentation
            </li>
            <li>
                Server / client implemented. You now first have to use MVAnalyse, and
                then the filter you want. Look at the documentation and at the examples I'll
                give alter.
            </li>
            <li>
                MVCompensate is separated from MVShow ( it's more logic that way ). For
                the moment, it doesn't move the chroma ( same behavior as MVShow in the latest
                releases )
            </li>
            <li>
                Some cleaning in MVBlur / MVInterpolate / MVConvertFPS, but still some
                work to do. Now, MVBlur blurs around the frame, not between the frame and the
                previous one.
            </li>
            <li>
                Half of the work is done for writing vectors to a file. But the resulting
                file will be large ( around 500 MB - 1 GB I guess ).
            </li>
            <li>MVDenoise is slightly faster ( at least it should )</li>
            <li>
                Copies are optimized inside the filter, thanks to avisynth's copy
                functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                MVShow can display the mean SAD of the compensation ( using showsad =
                true )
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>MVInterpolate makes its come back.</li>

                MVBlur and MVConvertFPS have been improved. They also have got new
                parameters, have a look at the documentation.
            </li>
            <li>MVShow gets back its compensate mode ( MVShow(cm = true) )</li>
